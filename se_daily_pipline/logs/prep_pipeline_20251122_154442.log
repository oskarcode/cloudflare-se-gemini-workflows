Executing command (Default Model)...
Okay, I understand my role and the task. I will proceed by first setting up the context by getting your timezone and profile, then identifying customer meetings, and finally processing each meeting to generate and append preparation documents to the Google Doc.
Okay, user's timezone is `America/New_York`, email is `oskar@cloudflare.com`, so the internal domain is `cloudflare.com`. Next week runs from Monday, November 24, 2025, to Sunday, November 30, 2025. I'll now fetch all events for that period using `calendar.listEvents`.
